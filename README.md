<h1 align="center">TypeScript Project - Car Shop</h1>
<h3 align="center">This was a project developed in the back-end module of Web Development Course of <a href=https://www.betrybe.com>Trybe</a></h3>
<br>

ðŸ”­ In this project, I applied the #SOLID architecture principles and the #OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles in a football championship board.

</br>

For this project, you will apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build a CRUD API to manage a car dealership. This will be done using the MongoDB database through the Mongoose framework.

I built a dockerized back-end using data modeling through Mongoose queries toa Mongo database. The development respected the business rules provided in the project and the API is capable of being consumed by an already provided front-end.

In this project, I also implemented the concepts of TDD, SOLID in addition to the organization of the project in MSC layers.

<h3>:gear: Instructions</h3>

------------

<p>To run the repository locally, clone the project and use the following commands to initialize Docker and install the dependencies:</p>

````
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it trybers_and_dragons bash
npm install // to install the dependencies
npm run dev // to execute the app and enable the api to receive requests in any Rest API Client, like Thunder Client
docker-compose down // to completely stop the application
````

## How can I run the created tests?
Considering that you have already installed all the necessary dependencies, thus running **Car Shop**, for testing purposes, you can run the following commands:

Run all the tests created for the *Model, Controller* and *Service* layers:
```bash
npm run test
```

Check full test coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
